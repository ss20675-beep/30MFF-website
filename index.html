  <h2>About NYU Abu Dhabi</h2>
  </h3>A Global Campus with Local Roots.</h3>
  <p>
      NYU Abu Dhabi opened its doors in 2010 with a bold vision: to create a truly global university that brings together the best of New York and the Middle East. But beyond the facts and figures, NYUAD feels like home. Imagine walking into a classroom where every voice comes from a different corner of the world ‚Äî and every conversation stretches your perspective. That is the everyday reality here.

    <h2>Campus Tour</h2>
    <p>
      When I first explored the campus, I wanted to capture the energy of the place, the mix of modern architecture, creative spaces, and student life buzzing in every corner. This video is my way of bringing you along for the walk.

      Whether it is the Library Dome, the Art Center, or simply the courtyard where friends gather at sunset, every corner of NYUAD tells a story. Which spot would be your favorite?

  <!-- The Student Life Section -->

  <section id="student-life" class="content-section">
  <h2>Student Life</h2>
  <p>
    Student life here is as diverse as the people who call this campus home.Mornings often start with coffee at the Marketplace, afternoons are filled with classes, research, or sports, and evenings bring cultural nights, theater performances, or a casual game of volleyball under the floodlights.What makes it truly special is the rhythm of traditions shared ‚Äî Eid dinners in September, Diwali lights in October, Lunar New Year festivals in February. At NYUAD, you do not just learn about the world, you live it

    <h3>Beyond the Campus Gates</h3>
    <p>
      Step outside campus and you will discover a city that is just as dynamic as NYUAD itself. Stroll along the Corniche, visit the Louvre Abu Dhabi, or venture into the desert dunes for a taste of adventure. But exploration is not only about Abu Dhabi. With opportunities for internships, research, and global study at NYU New York and NYU Shanghai, this campus is a launchpad to anywhere. For me, NYUAD is not just where I study ‚Äî it is where I have started to imagine what is possible. Where will it take you?
